What does a note taking app do?
Note-taking applications (also called note-taking app) allow people to: Store all notes and important information digitally, usually in a cloud-based storage system. 

An app that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. My first foray into using express and writing back-end code.

# All Files 
In order to make note taking app mostly i used js and node js. And i used bootstrab to save my time.

# Js 
In Js i apply css bootstrap to use front-end framework for looks more beautifull.

# Views 
In views i did main page and use ejs because it i found it was easy to me.
